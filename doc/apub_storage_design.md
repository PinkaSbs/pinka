## Keyspace

Each server uses only one keyspace.

## Partitions

Partitions may be used as primary key and blob store, or as secondary index.

### Objects

Stores all activities received by from inbox or outbox, and actors or objects
referenced by activities, local or remote. Objects extracted from activities are
separately stored in the same partition.

| Primary key              | Value |
|--------------------------|-------|
| ObjectKey(uuid_7: bytes) | Object|

KV separation should be enabled on this partition.

### IRI Index

Index mapping object @id to object key.

| Primary key   | Value              |
|---------------|--------------------|
| @id: String   | ObjectKey          |

### Users Index

Stores index to local actor profiles.

| Primary key | Value        |
|-------------|--------------|
| uid: String | ObjectKey    |

The following ActivityPub properties are generated automatically

* inbox
* outbox
* followers

Currently there is no *following* or *liked* collection.

### Outbox Index

Stores all activities generated by local actors.

| Primary key (UID, SortKey)  | Value           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| uid: String, uuid_7: bytes  | ObjectKey       |

### Likes Index

Stores all likes received from inbox for objects.

| Primary key (IRI, SortKey) | Value (Activity pk) |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| @id: String, uuid_7: bytes | ObjectKey           |

### Shares Index

Stores all shares received from inbox for objects.

| Primary key (IRI, SortKey) | Value (Activity pk) |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| @id: String, uuid_7: bytes | ObjectKey           |

### Followers

Stores all followers of local actors.

| Primary key (UID, SortKey)| Value       |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| uid: String, uuid_7: bytes| ObjectKey   |

If needed we might have to add a reverse index to support efficient unfollow
activity. For now we will just iterate through all prefixes.

### Activity Context Index

Index mapping context @id to activities. This can be used to find all activities
related to a context.

| Primary key (IRI, SortKey)   | Value              |
|------------------------------|--------------------|
| @id: String, uuid_7: bytes   | ObjectKey          |
